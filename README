You can easily see the language when you go the site and look at the url, the part after www.ikea.com/ will be the language
split by a '/' for example www.ikea.com/se/sv/

  - const baseCurrency = "EUR";   // The base currency used in the country you are comparing to, (the one you put in above ^^ )
  - const otherCurrency = "EUR";  // The currency you want that article's price to be shown in (the currency you use)
